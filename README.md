# Morse-code
## Simple Project to learn and study Morse Code that turns strings into dash and point string as a morse code
#### The idea is to have a project tha can be used to convert simple text into morse code (dashes ans points)
#### also converto from morse to simple text, it is good to avoid using special chars because it may cause loss of some data

##It also use the concept of Prosings:
#### Procedure signs or prosigns are shorthand signals used in radio telegraphy procedures, for the purpose of simplifying and 
#### standardizing communications related to radio operating issues among two or more radio operators. 
#### They are distinct from general Morse code abbreviations, which consist mainly of brevity codes that convey messages to other parties with greater speed and accuracy.

###  Below the list of prosings and the commented meaning after: --

                {"<AA>","·-·-"}, -- UNKNOWN STATION
                {"<AR>","·-·-·"}, -- OUT
                {"<AS>","·-···"}, -- WAIT
                {"<BT>","-···-"}, -- BREAK
                {"<CT>","-·-·-"}, -- Start of transmission[4] Start of new message.[1]
                {"<HH>","........"}, -- Error / correction[4][1]
                {"<K>","-·-"}, -- Invitation for any station to transmit[4][1]
                {"<KN>","-·--·"}, -- Invitation for named station to transmit[1]
                {"<NJ>","-··---"}, -- Shift to Wabun code (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabun_code)
                {"<SK>","···-·-"}, -- End of contact[1] / End of work[4]
                {"<SN>","···-·"}, -- Understood.[1] Verified.[4]
                {"<SOS>","···---···"}, -- Start of distress signal[4][1]
                {"<BK>","-··· -·-"}, -- Break in conversation[1]
                {"<CL>","-·-· ·-··"}, -- Closing down[1]
